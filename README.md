# Cross-Cultural Linguistic Analysis of Educational Discourse

This repository contains a computational linguistics project comparing two educational articles — one from **Iceland** and one from **Saudi Arabia** — using Python and natural language processing (NLP) tools.

The aim is to identify **linguistic differences and similarities** in how education is discussed in different cultural and national contexts.

## 🌍 Project Overview

The project performs a comparative analysis of:

- **Part-of-Speech (POS) distributions**
- **Lexical richness and variety**
- **Sentence and word length**
- **Frequent word types (e.g., nouns, verbs, adjectives)**
- **Syntactic and stylistic patterns**

The two texts analyzed:
- 🇮🇸 **Icelandic article** on modern approaches to education (translated into English)
- 🇸🇦 **Saudi Arabian article** discussing education reforms (originally in English)

## 🛠️ Technologies and Libraries

- Python 3.x
- [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/) — POS tagging, tokenization, stopword handling
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` — for visualizations
- `collections` — for frequency distributions

## 🔍 Methods

Key steps in the analysis include:

1. **Tokenization** of texts into sentences and words  
2. **POS tagging** with `nltk.pos_tag()`  
3. **Frequency analysis** of different word classes  
4. **TTR (Type-Token Ratio)** and lexical density calculation  
5. **Stopword filtering** for content word comparison  
6. **Visualizations** of POS and word-type frequencies
